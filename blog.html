		<h1>Starbuzz launches... Tweet Sip</h1>

	<p>
		As promised, today I'm proud to announce that Starbuzz
		Coffee is launching the Tweet Sip cup, a special Starbuzz 
		Coffee cup that tweets each time you take a sip! Check 
		out my video of our new invention.

		<h1>Starbuzz meets social media</h1>
		<time datetime="2012-03-12">3/12/2012</time>
	</header>
	<p>
		Here at Starbuzz we're embracing the social media craze. 
		In fact, we're going further than any of our competitors and 
		we're very close to announcing a revolutionary new product that 
		links your coffee drinking directly to your social 
		network. Forget "checking in"; we're going way beyond that, and 
		with this new product every sip of smooth, aromatic, hot Starbuzz 
		blend is going to to be shared with your social network.
	</p>
	<p>
		Sound like science fiction?  It's not; I'm already 
		testing our final prototype social network cup as I write this, 
		which links you, the drinker, right to your favorite social 
		networks.  We've made a huge investment to make this happen 
		and we've created a reusable coffee cup complete with RFID, 
		NFC, Bluetooth, and Wifi (not to mention a few more things the tech 
		folks know about, because hey, I'm just the coffee guy).
	</p>
	<p>
		So, keep your eyes out for this amazing new cup. And I'll 
		be releasing a video teaser soon to tell you all about this 
		new invention, straight from Starbuzz Coffee.

		<h1>Starbuzz uses computer science</h1>
		<time datetime="2012-03-10">3/10/2012</time>
	</header>
	<p>
		Have you ever noticed how efficient a Starbuzz Coffee 
		house is? The lines alway move fast, and despite the 
		astronomical number of different drinks any customer can 
		order, we have your drink up, hot (or cold if that's the 
		way you want it) and ready in seconds. How do we do it? 
	</p>
	<p>
		To pull this off, we take advantage of the latest and 
		greatest in computer science.  In fact, we train 
		our staff to be one big distributed computer.  The cashiers 
		create the orders for the distributed computer, complete 
		with your name and the drinks special instructions.  Then 
		our specialized drink makers grab the next cup
		and go about working on your order until it's finished.  
	</p>
	<p>
		With this design, we are able to horizontally scale our operation 
		any time we want.  All we need to do is add more cashiers 
		and drink makers (not to mention a fair amount of support 
		staff you never see) as the customer flow grows.

		<h1>Most unique patron of the month	</h1>
		<time datetime="2012-02-18">2/18/2012</time>
	</header>
	<p>
		Our most unique patron of the month award goes to a 
		customer in Poulsbo, Washington, whose daily morning order 
		is a "six-splenda, no-foam, 130-degree non-fat-soy latte, 
		with the splenda stirred in before the milk is added." Do we 
		have unique customers or what?

        Why wait?  You can order all our fine coffees right from the Internet with our new, 
        automated Bean Machine.  How does it work?  Just click on the Bean Machine link, 
        enter your order, and behind the scenes, your coffee is roasted, ground 
        (if you want), packaged, and shipped to your door.
